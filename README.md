# NPC-MRISegmentationToolkit

This toolkit accompanies the data analysis presented in the paper titled "A dataset of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma MRI with multi-modalities segmentation."

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need `pip` for installing the required packages.

### Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this study is available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10900202). To download the dataset, execute the script provided:

```bash
python download_dataset.py
```
## Usage

### Computing Morphological Parameters and Post-processing

To compute the morphological parameters for a specific patient and ROI sequence, use the following command:

```bash
python morphological_parameters.py <patient_id> <roi_sequence>
```

For example:

```bash
python morphological_parameters.py 1 "ROI-T1"
```
### MRI Post-processing

For de-identification and extracting MRI parameters, the following command can be used:

```bash
python dicom_processor.py <patient_id> <mri_sequence>
```

For example:

```bash
python dicom_processor.py 1 "T1WI"
```

### MRI Image Converter

To automate the resizing and conversion of MRI images from DICOM and NIfTI formats to TIFF, run the command

```bash
python mri_image_converter.py --resolution <desired-resolution>
```
